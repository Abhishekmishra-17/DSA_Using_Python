## Introduction

This repository contains Python implementations of popular data structures and algorithms. Each topic is accompanied by commented code for easy understanding and, where applicable, example usage.

## Features

- Clear and concise Python implementations
- Well-commented code for better understanding
- Examples and test cases for most implementations
- Structured directory for easy navigation

## Data Structures Covered

- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks
- Queues (Standard, Circular, Priority)
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Heap)
- Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
- Hash Tables
- Others (as added)

## Algorithms Covered

- Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap)
- Searching (Linear, Binary)
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, Prim's)
- Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Others (as added)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhishekmishra-17/DSA_Using_Python.git
   cd DSA_Using_Python
   ```

2. **Explore the directories:**
   - Each data structure/algorithm has its own folder or file.
   - Example usage is provided within code files or in a `test` folder (if available).

3. **Run the code:**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Execute files directly:
     ```bash
     python <filename>.py
     ```
